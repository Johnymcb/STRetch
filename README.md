# STRetch

Method for detecting pathogenic STR expansions from next-gen sequencing data.

STRetch requires paired end reads to work. It is primarily intended for use on
whole genome sequencing data, but can also be run on exome or other targeted
sequencing data, although size estimates should be interpreted with caution.

Please see the [STRetch wiki](https://github.com/Oshlack/STRetch/wiki)
for installation and usage instructions.
